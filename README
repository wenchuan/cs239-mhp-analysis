First visitor:
Walk the Syntax Tree
  generate statements table (Integer->String)
  generate another table that map function to a list of statements
  generate another tree, hold only these element

  This organization resemble Featherweight X10's architecture.

    l_s:      labeled statement
    s1; s2    sequence of statement
    async(s)
    finish(s)
    loop(s)
    
    Function

Second visitor:
Apply MHP fomula to generated tree, every node have {M, O, L}

Print out M info at last



Problem:
1. How to handle function calls, more importantly, recursive function calls.
  That func1 calls func1, or func1 calls func2 which calls func1.
2. How to translate miniX10 structures into these elementary representation.
